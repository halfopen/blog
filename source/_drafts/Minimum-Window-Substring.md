### [76\. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/)

Difficulty: **Hard**



Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

**Example:**

```
**Input: S** = "ADOBECODEBANC", **T** = "ABC"
**Output:** "BANC"
```

**Note:**

*   If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string `""`.
*   If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.



#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string minWindow(string s, string t) {
        
    }
};
```
