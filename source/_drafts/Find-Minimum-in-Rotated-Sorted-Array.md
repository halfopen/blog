### [153\. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)

Difficulty: **Medium**



Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `0 1 2 4 5 6 7` might become `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.



#### Solution
```
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        
    }
}
```
