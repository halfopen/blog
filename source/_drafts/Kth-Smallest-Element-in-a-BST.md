### [230\. Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/description/)

Difficulty: **Medium**



Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the **k**th smallest element in it.

**Note:**  
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

**Follow up:**  
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

求二叉搜索树中第k小的元素


#### Solution
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int kthSmallest(TreeNode root, int k) {
        
    }
}
```
