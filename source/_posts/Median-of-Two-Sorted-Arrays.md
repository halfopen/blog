### [4\. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/)

求两个有序数组的中位数，要求时间复杂度不低于O(log(m+n))

Difficulty: **Hard**

There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

**Example 1:**  

```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

**Example 2:**  

```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

#### My Solution
```
class Solution {
    public double findMedianSortedArrays(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        
    }
}
```
